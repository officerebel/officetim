<!-- Insert your main content here -->
<p> My name is Tim Vogt. And I am a lead developer for a Dutch company called Into the Source.
As a developer I build software with my team and I lead the development, architecture, and make choices about infrastructure and code style and way of deployment.</p>

<p>We make software for Vadain. An company who sells curtains world wide. And produces around the globe in 6 places. With my team we make several cool projects which you can see here. I share code snippets here and <router-link to="blog"><u>here</u></router-link> more about this.</p>
